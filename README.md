CLINIQ – Intelligent Clinical Quality & Risk Management Platform

Project Overview

CLINIQ is a smart, data-driven web platform designed to enhance clinical trial quality, risk monitoring, and operational efficiency. It centralizes critical clinical data and transforms it into actionable insights using analytics and AI-powered intelligence.

The platform helps research teams, coordinators, and stakeholders identify risks early, monitor subject and site performance, and maintain high data quality standards, all through a clean, intuitive dashboard.

Problem Statement

Clinical trials generate large volumes of complex data across multiple sites, subjects, and timelines.
Current challenges include:

Difficulty in early risk detection

Fragmented data across systems

Limited real-time visibility into site and subject performance

Manual monitoring leading to delays and errors

Poor data quality impacting trial outcomes

These issues reduce efficiency, increase costs, and can compromise trial reliability.

Proposed Solution

CLINIQ addresses these challenges by providing a unified, intelligent monitoring system that:

Aggregates clinical data into a single dashboard

Computes risk scores for subjects and sites

Tracks data quality indicators (DQI)

Highlights high-risk subjects and trends

Uses AI-driven insights to support proactive decision-making

The platform enables teams to act before issues escalate, rather than reacting after damage is done.
