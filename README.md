ClinIQ — Clinical Data Quality Intelligence Platform

ClinIQ is a full-stack clinical intelligence platform that fuses multiple clinical datasets into a real-time Data Quality Intelligence (DQI) engine. It enables sponsors, CRAs, and operations teams to detect patient-level and site-level risks early — before they become regulatory failures.

Why ClinIQ Matters

Traditional dashboards only visualize problems.
ClinIQ predicts them.

It transforms raw operational clinical data into:

Early regulatory risk detection

CRA prioritization

Operational decision intelligence
